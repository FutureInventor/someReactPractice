// IMPORTANT!
// This repo is terribly outdated. I keep it just so that I can compare it with my current projects,

// Anyway, if you're in a mood for digging in an old, questionable quality, not-even-junior-level codebase, be my guest :)

This web application is a project in which I tried to gather and show off all of my web-developers skills. 

Main functionalities:
- token-based authentication, 
- different levels of permissions for users,
- comunication with a database by REST API,
- displaying data generated from XLM file to JSON in a tree,
- real-time tracking login status of users,
- editing user's data from the level of users interface.

Things to do:
- seciurity of sending requests still has to be improved,
- adding new books to collection,
- rating and reviewing the books,
- UI still has to be improved as well,
- code still has to be optimized in terms of size and time complexity.

Used technologies:  
- ReactJS - front-end,
- PHP 7 - back-end,
- Ant design - Recat UI,
- MySQL - database.
